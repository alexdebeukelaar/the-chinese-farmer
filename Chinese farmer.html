<h4>The story</h4>

<p><strong>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <q class="villagers"><i>We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</i></q></br> The farmer said,<q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe</strong>.</q> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,<q class ="villagers">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said,<q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe.</strong></q>

The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.</br> The neighbors then said,<q class="villagers">Oh dear, that’s too bad,</q> and the farmer responded,<q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe</strong>.</q>The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,<q class = "villagers"> “Isn’t that great!”</q> Again, he said,<q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe</strong>.</q></strong>

<center>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <strong><em class="good">good</em></strong> or <strong><em class="bad">bad</em></strong> because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</center>

<h4>Conclusion </h4> 
<strong> <em class="good">Good</em></strong> or <strong><em class="bad">bad</em></strong> are just one  perspective. Bananas are <em class="good">good</em> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <em class="good">good</em> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
